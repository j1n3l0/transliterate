# transliterate

Provides a transliterate function for clojure

## Usage

(tr "a-zA-Z0-9" "_" "This is a test, 123." :s) ;; => "_ _ _ _, _."

## Notes

This Library currently depends on the jtr java library (http://jtr.sourceforge.net/).
Plan to make it pure clojure after working out the kinks in the java API :)
